Do skybox properly

Onscreen console:
    Requires facility to draw UI
    Get text from keypresses
    System for some subsystem to have input "focus"

Collision detection:
    Collision Hulls on entities
    Diff colision algorithms for diff Collsion Hulls

Proper Player 3D Model

Render Untextured Meshes

Gravity & Player Jump

Difuse shader for untextured objects

SubMeshes, bones and animation.

"Reload level" functionality
Tidy up rendering code.

BUG! Can't put code after set_player() in init.lua

Different level save format (lua is cool for scripting, but a super weird level storage format)
